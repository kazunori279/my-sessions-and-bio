### Agenda

How does Google find valuable data in milliseconds from the vast sea of the Internet contents? Vector similarity search is the core information retrival technology that realizes the user experience of Google's core services including Google Search, YouTube, Play and many others. Another key component is the Two-Tower model that learns the relationships from pairs of query and candidate features, extending the capability of the information retrieval far from the traditional recommendation algorithms. As Google Cloud released those as a commercial service, businesses are starting to incorporate them for transforming their services. We will learn the technology details and how users are applying them in the real-world solutions.
